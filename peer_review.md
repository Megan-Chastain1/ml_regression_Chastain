1. Clarity & Organization (Is the notebook structured and easy to follow?)
   
    The Notebook is easy to follow, the sections are labelled clearly. Imports are easy to see at the top of the sections they are used in. The introduction is succinct and explains nicely what the project was about. 
  

3. Feature Selection & Justification (Do the chosen features make sense given the objectives?)
   
     Brenda clearly stated why they chose their X and y features and gave evidence (heat map) as to why they chose them.
   
     X = cylinders, displacement, horsepower, weight.

     y = mpg

    The objective of their project was to determine fuel efficiency based on engine specifications and weight. The feature vaules are exactly what's needed to explore the objective.

   
5. Model Performance & Comparisons (Are the results and comparisons clearly explained?)

     The summary table was clear and listed the results of the 3 regression models Brenda chose. It is easy to see which model worked the best and based on their conclusions.

7. Reflection Quality (Are insights well thought out?)

    I think Brenda could have discussed the results of the regression model tests, as the MAE was higher than I would have thought it would be. Brenda could have discussed reasons as to why this is and what could have been done to get better results.
